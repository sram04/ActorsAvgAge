Development Environment & Execution Instructions:

I have used Eclipse IDE and Java to solve the challenge.

Inorder to accomplish tasks like "Parsing a JSON", "Calculating Age difference" i have used external libraries like
Org.JSON and JODA Time. 

I wanted to make sure this project could be executable outside any IDE i..e the solution should be executable via 
Command Prompt or a Terminal, so i have exported a runnable jar from eclipse along with all required libraries.

To execute the solution from a command prompt / Terminal on a machine with Java installed, run the following command -

java -jar AverageCastAge.jar
