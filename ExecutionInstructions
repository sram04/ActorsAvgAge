Development Environment & Execution Instructions:

I have used Eclipse IDE and Java to solve the challenge.

Inorder to accomplish tasks like "Parsing a JSON", "Calculating Age difference" i have used external libraries like
Org.JSON and JODA Time. 

I wanted to make sure this project could be executable outside any IDE i..e the solution should be executable via 
Command Prompt or a Terminal, so i have exported a runnable jar from eclipse along with all required libraries.

The .jar file should be available under the "Release" link of the git repository and can be downloaded.

To execute the solution from a command prompt / Terminal on a machine with Java installed, run the following command -

java -jar AverageCastAge.jar
