ActorsAvgAge
============

Approach and Data considerations:

Initial idea to solve the challenge

1. Find resources to capture "Movies" and "Actor Data"
2. Use a JSON Parser to parse and save required information
3. Perform calculations to find average age of cast for each movie

Currently considering the Rotten Tomatoes API, which has information about
list of movies that are being shown in theatres as on today's date as well
as complete list of cast for each movie.

Few example get requests are mentioned below:

Get complete cast for a given movie
http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771355766/cast.json?apikey=6rfdvqjd4kxp22car8fu9c4m

Get the list of movies that are being show in theatres now:
http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/lists/movies/in_theaters.json?apikey=6rfdvqjd4kxp22car8fu9c4m

Update/Design Change :
Rotten Tomatoes API restricts number of JSON items per page to a maximum of 50. So, we need to capture movies in
theatres using a loop.

Once, we have list of movies and actors associated with those movies, we can then use freebase data to capture
each actors date of birth.

Sample freebase query :
[{
  "type": "/film/film",
  "name": "Snatch",
  "starring": [{
    "actor": [{
      "name": "Brad Pitt",
      "/people/person/date_of_birth": null
    }]
  }]
}]

and sample get url :

https://www.googleapis.com/freebase/v1/mqlread/?lang=%2Flang%2Fen&query=[{ "/people/person/date_of_birth": null,"name": "Scott Adist","type": "/film/actor"}]

Few exceptions and Design considerations:

There are few movies which are fairly new and some actors from the cast of those movies are not available in the Freebase.
Say there are 10 actors in a movie and freebase has only 8 actors from the above said 10, in these scenarios i have considered
the average to be totalage/8 instead of totalage/10.

Incase, there is a movie where none of its actors are available in Free base, i have displayed that we do not have enough
information to capture average cast age.
